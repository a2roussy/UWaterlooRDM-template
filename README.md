# UWaterloo README Template

This README template has been created for researchers who would like to create GitHub repositories for research code. It has been designed for multidisciplinary usage, meaning not all information fields will be applicable for every repository. For best practice, include all relevant information that can support the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of your code. 

The README template can also be used for internal data management or for deposits in other repositories.  

If you have questions about what information to include for your repository, contact Waterloo’s RDM team (LibraryRDM@uwaterloo.ca).
